## Testing Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything works:

### Docker Test
```bash
# Clean start
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up

# Should see:
# - Dependencies installing
# - Application building
# - Server starting on port 3000
# - No errors in logs

# Test access
curl http://localhost:3000
# Should return HTML
```

### Local Development Test
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Should see:
# - All dependencies installed
# - Build completed successfully
# - Server started

# Test access
curl http://localhost:3000
# Should return HTML
```

## Pre-Deployment Final Checks

Before sharing or deploying:

1. **Remove sensitive data**: Check `.env` for any production secrets
2. **Test Docker build**: Run `docker-compose up` from scratch
3. **Verify documentation**: Ensure all README files are up to date
4. **Check API keys**: Confirm demo keys work (they have rate limits)
5. **Test on clean machine**: Clone repo to new location and test
6. **Verify port availability**: Ensure port 3000 is free or documented
7. **Check browser compatibility**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
8. **Mobile responsive**: Test on mobile device or browser dev tools

## Success Criteria

The project is ready when:

- [x] `docker-compose up` works without any configuration
- [x] Application loads in browser immediately
- [x] Location search returns results
- [x] Weather data displays correctly
- [x] Maps load properly
- [x] No errors in console
- [x] Works on a fresh machine with only Docker installed
- [x] All documentation is clear and accurate

## Notes

- Demo API keys are included for immediate functionality
- Users can replace with their own keys for production use
- Supabase is optional for the favorites feature
- Application works completely offline after initial data load
- No Redis, Postgres, or worker processes needed (single container)
